# Power 4
Welcome to the Power 4 project! This classic game lets you play against another player by placing chips in a grid and trying to line up four chips of your color.
## Technologies used
- HTML**: Game structure.
- CSS**: Styles and layout.
- JavaScript**: Game logic.

## Prerequisites
Before launching the game, make sure you have installed the **Live Server** extension in your code editor. This extension enables you to launch a local server to view your game in real time.

## Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository on your machine:
   ```
   git clone https://url.git
2. Go to the project directory:
    ```
    cd your-directory
## Launch the game

To launch the game, you have two options:

With Live Server

    Open your code editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code).
    Open the folder containing the index.html file.
    Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server".

Without Live Server

If you don't have the Live Server extension, you can also launch the project using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```start index.html```

Your Power 4 game will then open in your default browser.
